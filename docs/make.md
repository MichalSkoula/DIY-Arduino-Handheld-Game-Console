## Make ARCO 1500

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
        <p>Building a console is a breeze. On the right you can see the picture of the connection - you only need a few components:</p>


        <ul>
            <li>Arduino UNO</li>
            <li>Half size breadboard</li>
            <li>OLED 128x64 (I2C)</li>
            <li>Passive buzzer</li>
            <li>2 buttons</li>
            <li>5 way joystick</li>
            <li>about 20 jumper cables (10 cm, male to male)</li>
            <li>power - 4x AA batteries and battery holder with 9V battery jack</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The next step is to place everything in a ready-made, 3D printed console. Both breadboard and Arduino just snap into the brackets. 
        Glue the battery holder to the bottom and route the cable through the hole in the side.</p>
