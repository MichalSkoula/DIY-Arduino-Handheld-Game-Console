## Build ARCO 1500, with your own parts

ARCO 1500 is an **open source project**, so you can take the source and make it your own (or you can [buy the complete set](/buy.html)).

All you need is some affordable electronic stuff (Arduino), 3D printed case (optional) and programing skills. 
No PCB, soldering - just Arduino, breadboard, OLED, joystick, buzzer and some jumper cables. Use the 
<a href="{{ site.github_url }}">GitHub link</a> to get source files.

The setup is simple:
