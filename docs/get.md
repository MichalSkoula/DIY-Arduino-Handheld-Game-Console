# .. or Make it with your own parts

ARCO 1500 is an **open source project**, so you can take the source and make it your own. All you need is some affordable electronic parts and our 3D printed case (optional). No PCB, soldering. Here is the list of components: 

<ul>
    {% for part in site.data.parts %}
        <li> {{ part.name }} </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

Get the latest release from [GitHub]({{ site.github_url }}releases). Continue to [Make page](/make.html) to get basic idea of how to make it.
